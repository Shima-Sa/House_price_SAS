INTRODUCTION
This project aims to find how different features of houses affect sales prices. There are two datasets, one containing house features (housing_data) and the other containing sales details (price_sale). By analysing different features, we can find the most influential features on house prices. This analysis will help to identify key factors for house pricing and predicting house prices. It is valuable for the real estate industry and potential house buyers.
Data
Two data sets are combined based on the ID_House in the SAS. There are 200 rows, eight columns for housing and 210 rows, and five columns for pricing. The final dataset has 200 rows and 12 columns (ID needs to be deleted). The target variable price is numerical.
